"""Behavioral tests for .github/scripts/review-findings-gate.sh — the stateless
merge gate: RED until the automated reviewer has posted at least one review AND
no unresolved reviewer-rooted thread still carries a gating finding (🔴
blocking / 🟡 warning — read from the hidden `<!-- severity: … -->` marker on
the thread's ROOT comment, with the leading emoji as a fallback for threads
posted before the marker existed); GREEN otherwise.

Two modes, one predicate:
  * REPORT_SHA set — the verdict is POSTed as a check run named "Review
    findings resolved" on that sha; the run exits 0 whatever the verdict, and a
    failed POST is a hard red (a gate that cannot report leaves the required
    check hanging at "Expected").
  * REPORT_SHA unset — the exit status IS the report (merge_group mode; the
    workflow parses the PR number out of the merge-group ref, tested below).

Drives the REAL script (sourcing the real lib/pr-reviews.bash and
lib/review-threads.bash) with a fake `gh` on PATH that serves the two GraphQL
reads from canned node arrays by running the script's OWN --jq programs through
REAL jq — so the reviewer filter, the severity selection, and the emoji
fallback are exercised, never re-implemented — and records the check-run POST's
fields for assertion. gh is stubbed because there is no live GitHub to ask; the
node shapes mirror the GraphQL documents in the two lib files (in particular:
GraphQL returns an app bot's login WITHOUT the REST `[bot]` suffix).

    Why a true SSOT is infeasible here: the required-check context is a GitHub job
    `name:`, and a job name cannot be computed — it must be a static literal in the
    workflow YAML. The gate script needs the same string at runtime to POST its
    check runs under that context. Nothing can generate both, and having the script
    grep the name out of the workflow at runtime trades this guard for hand-rolled
    YAML parsing in bash, which is worse.

    What the drift costs if it happens: every PR head reports a context nothing
    requires, and the required context is never reported at all — so PRs hang at
    "Expected" forever. That is why the duplication is guarded rather than left bare.
