# Fail-closed launcher for the plugin's bundled hooks.
#
# Usage:  safe-launch.sh <HookEvent> [--hook=... args]
#
# Claude Code treats a non-zero exit OR empty stdout from a hook as a
# NON-blocking hook error and lets the guarded action through UNGUARDED, so a
# hook that cannot start at all (node absent from PATH, a missing or truncated
# bundle) would silently disable the whole sanitization pipeline. This shim is
# what prevents that: when the bundle cannot run it still PRINTS the
# event-appropriate fail-closed verdict and exits 0.
#
# The event comes from an explicit leading argument (each hooks.json call site
# knows its event statically), never from the payload: Claude Code keys
# hookSpecificOutput on the ACTUAL event, so a wrong-event verdict shape is
# ignored — fail open — and a malformed payload must not get to pick the shape.
